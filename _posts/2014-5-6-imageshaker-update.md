If you have no idea what [ImageShaker](http://nathancod.es/ImageShaker/) is, you should check out my [last blog post](http://nathancod.es/2014/05/04/imageshaker/).



# Update
If you have used the internet before, you may be familiar with the tradition of using the [Impact font](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/impact-font) in **big white text and a black outline**. I decided to add this *critical functionality* to ImageShaker. If you still aren't getting it, [this example will probably explain it to you](http://bit.ly/1hvzhS1).

The new functionality is accessable by an optional field on the ImageShaker form.



So [**get shaking!**](http://nathancod.es/ImageShaker/)
