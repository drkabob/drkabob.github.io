# I'm back!

A long time ago I had a website. But in the month of Decemeber 2013, my domain expired! And I was way too cheap to renew it. And so the site was gone, never to be heard of again... **Unitl today!**


## What's new?
Those of you familiar with the old site may be wondering, why is everything so different? I decided that with a new domain should come a new website as well. Unlike before, this site is going to be much more of a portolio than a blog. Its no longer powered by WordPress but instead by GitHub pages of all things. Yeah, turns out Jekyll (the system GitHub pages uses) is pretty awesome. Don't worry though, everything you're used to will come back eventually. The blog posts that nobody other than [one person](http://nisani.bot.nu/) would read are still going to be here. The overload of easter eggs will be back and more insane then ever.

Furthermore, this will be a great place to view all the stuff I have worked on and am working on. Much better than the last one anyway.

Either way, come and explore!
