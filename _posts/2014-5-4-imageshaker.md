# ImageShaker
The internet is a big fan of [vibrating GIFs.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vibrating-gifs) I thought I would help the makers of this "art form" out a bit with something so you can visualize what the GIF would turn out to be. In the future I might make something that actually outputs a GIF using some of the code from [Jiffy](https://github.com/drkabob/Jiffy) and the [Python Imaging Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library), but for now there is this.



Like [BeGeneric](http://nathancod.es/BeGeneric), it is entirely in JavaScript. You fill out an HTML form and it generates the webpage for you with some JavaScript. Since I have moved my website to GitHub Pages, I have not been able to use any server-side scripting, which has forced me to use JavaScript. Honestly, I'm surprised about how dynamic and useful JavaScript can be.



Either way, you can check out ImageShaker [here](http://nathancod.es/ImageShaker). And some examples [here](http://bit.ly/1uornms) and [here](http://bit.ly/1nXthce).



**Have fun!**
